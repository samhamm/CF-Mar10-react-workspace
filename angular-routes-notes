ANGULAR ROUTES
--------------

Allow us to mock out the routing stuff we did on the server side; the difference is that we don't have actual routes

Hash Routes
The routing happens in the client
#/something

Tyler has merged to master everything up to today, including the insanity of the directives and things e added yesterday (including re-organization of the project directory structure)

$ bower install --save angular-route

Our first global dependency injection into notesApp

Now angular-route will be required in client.js

Cannot define routes until the end of the file, because everything else needs to load first.
notesApp.config is the thing that needs to be at the end

notesApp.config([$routeProvider, function($routeProvider) {
  stuff..........
}]);

I did not build out the rest of this anywhere, but it is some cool stuff.
Probably will want to watch the video to see the process.

localhost:3000/#/notes is how this comes out

Angular handles the routing to the right of the #
